# Introduction
Hello everyone!
My name is Lanyero Deborah, I am an Outreachy applicant, a Ugandan by nationality and new to open source contribution. I am a software Programmer looking to solidify my skills in Web development and technical writing.


I am also a volunteer coach at the Pyladies Kampala community, a focus group that aims at encouraging its participants contribute to the Python Open source software projects. For this reason I am constantly looking for avenues to not only build my capacity but also share accurate and valid content at my community level hence my interest in the accessibility wagtail project.


I look forward to utilizing this contribution period to collaborate with this fabulous community, Cheers!
